# Wiggles - My React Native UI Exploration

Welcome to Wiggles, my personal React Native project created to dive into the world of mobile app UI development using React Native. This project serves as my sandbox to experiment with different React Native UI components, navigation patterns, and styling techniques.

## Purpose

Wiggles is a learning playground where I can explore, tinker, and gain hands-on experience in crafting beautiful and responsive user interfaces for mobile applications. It's a journey to enhance my skills in React Native development and create visually appealing apps.
